## 🛠 Step 1: Create a Screen-Sized Container

#### #setup

* 👉 Start by creating a `ZStack` as your main container.

* 👉 Set its background color to OxfordBlue.

* 👉 Use `.ignoresSafeArea(.all)` to make it cover the entire screen.



---



## 📏 Step 2: Align Content Vertically

#### #layout

* 👉 Now that you have your canvas, how will you align your masterpiece vertically?

* 👉 Think about which SwiftUI layout can make this happen!



---



### 🎨 Step 3: Add an Image

#### #visuals

* 👉 Import an image into your project, or use the stock `student` image.

* 👉 Make it pop at the top of the screen.

* 👉 Use `.resizable()` and `.scaledToFill()` to make it fit just right.



---



### 📝 Step 4: Text and White Background

#### #text

* 👉 Time for some words! Create another container for your text.

* 👉 Paint it white with a `.background()`.

* 👉 Add a welcome message, a headline, and a sub-headline.



---



### 🖲 Step 5: Add a Button

#### #interaction

* 👉 Now let's make it interactive! Add a button at the bottom.

* 👉 You can keep the action empty for now.

* 👉 Got text and an icon? Line 'em up!
